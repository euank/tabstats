## tabstats

This addon shows a page containing tab statistics in a convenient UX.

It is especially useful for the following functionality

* Seeing the total number of tabs open
* Closing all tabs for a specific domain
* Closing all but one of a tab with many duplicates

### Installing this extension

Available on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-stats-expanded/).

### Using this extension

After installing this addon, a new button will be present in the upper-right of the browser window:

![image showing tabstat button location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2147649/156981016-6c972810-281e-4b33-858b-4bb92767abec.png)

Clicking on that button will open the addon's UX with information about open tabs.

### Why the fork?

The upstream repository appears to [not to be very actively maintained](https://github.com/glandium/tabstats/pull/11).

I forked this so I could add a feature I wanted, and I'll maintain this fork in some small degree.
